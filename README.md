# 1. Consider a web page that has a poem. The poem has a title, four paragraphs, and the author’s name. Using JQuery do the following:
• On clicking the title of the poem, the rest of the poem and the author’s details are visible or hidden.<br />
• Provide the “Author” button on clicking which the author is shown. Provide the “Show Para” button. On clicking it make the first paragraph that is not shown visible.<br />
• If a word is clicked in the para, then highlight that content.<br />
• On clicking the author name, display a small biography of the author, a picture of the author, and a short description of the poem, all of which can be individually hidden or shown by clicking them.<br />

# 2. Write a PHP program to check whether the given input (full name) first character belongs to a blood group or not. If it belongs to a blood group, print the user details like full name, age, city, and blood group in a tabular format, otherwise print the full name character by character in a new line. Use the HTML forms to get the details.

# 3. Consider the HTML form has the following details from the user and perform the data validation on the server side.
• The form has Product ID, Product Name, Product Category, Product Description, Imported – Yes or No radio button, Price and, Origin Country. Make sure the form is not submitted empty.<br />
• Product ID should always start with PID and then be followed by 6 digits which are unique.<br />
• The product name can contain only alphabets and spaces, convert the user entered spaces in underscore.<br />
• If the product belongs to more than one category, then they need to be separated by commas.<br />
• Product description must have only characters and numbers.<br />
• Price must be in number with two decimal points.<br />

# 4. FreshMart is a website that sells vegetables and fruits, developed using PHP and MySQL. Read user inputs through forms and include relevant details. Display the results on the webpage.
• Provide an option for adding, deleting, and updating in FreshMart detail.<br />
• Display FreshMart data based on user preferences(select option) such as vegetable name, price, type (vegetables or fruits), and produced by (organic or inorganic).<br />
• It provides search options for fruits and vegetables.<br />

# 5. Write a multidimensional array Javascript program to implement the given scenario for five students:
A university wants to provide a discount on the tuition fee to be paid by the freshers based on the conditions mentioned below.<br />
• If a student is the first graduate in their family and has secured more than 90% in school, then the student gets a discount of 50% on the college fee and 30% on the
hostel fee.<br />
• If the student received more than 90% in school but the student is not the first graduate in their family, then the student gets a 30% discount on the college and 10% on the hostel fee.<br />
• If the student is the first graduate in the family and has secured more than 80% in school, then he is given a discount of 15% on the college fee alone. Check for boundary conditions and print "Invalid Input" for the wrong output. Print two decimal places for output in the total fee (college and hostel fee).<br />

# 6. Consider an existing file that has some data. Write down the code to validate the data on the server side.
• Read the file. If the file text contains the word "VIT" in any case, then the entire data should be encrypted using a substitution cipher.<br />
• In a substitution cipher, every letter is substituted by the alphabet.<br />
• Every alphabet is substituted by 10 characters forward, so the alphabet A is substituted with K, the alphabet B is substituted with L, and so on. When the end is reached, it is circled back to the starting point, R is substituted by A, and so on. <br />
• Write the encoded text to a different file and use the current date and time as part of the file name. Display the encrypted data, file name and size to the user.<br />
